            <p>Any first steps to any destination can be difficult and challenging without the appropriate research, knowledge and understanding usually gained from having already completed those first steps.</p>
            <p>The cloud can at first seem daunting.  There are so many providers and within each provider there are so many offerings - the key is starting small with steady steps that have proved their worth.</p>
